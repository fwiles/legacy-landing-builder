      question: "Do I need a trust or is a will enough?",
      answer: "If you want to avoid probate, maintain privacy, or have a blended family or real estate, a trust is likely the better option. Wills alone require probate."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-2",
      question: "What happens if I die without a will or trust?",
      answer: "Each state has \"intestacy laws\" that dictate who gets what:\n\nâ€¢ You lose control over who inherits\n\nâ€¢ The court decides guardianship for your kids\n\nâ€¢ Probate is required â€” and can cost thousands"
    },
    {
      id: "faq-3",
      question: "How often should I update my plan?",
      answer: "Every 3â€“5 years, or after:\n\nâ€¢ Marriage, divorce, or birth/adoption\n\nâ€¢ Significant asset changes (buying property, business)\n\nâ€¢ Moving to a new state"
    },
    {
      id: "faq-4",
      question: "Can I do this all virtually?",
      answer: "Yes! Carter Legacy Planning serves clients across TX, NM, and AZ virtually. We handle consults by Zoom, provide secure digital document delivery, and coordinate notarization as needed."
